# Invisibility Cloak

A Python project that creates a real-time invisibility cloak effect using OpenCV and NumPy. The program detects a black-colored fabric and replaces it with a pre-recorded background, giving the illusion of disappearing.

## Features
- Real-time video processing using a webcam
- Detects black cloth as the "cloak"
- Smooth masking using morphological operations and Gaussian blur
- Fullscreen display for immersive effect
